Engine RPM Simulator Idea Layout (original idea before starting)

Holding throttle (w) will increase the RPM of the engine quickly

The higher the gear, the slower the RPM and speed will rise

Car will redline at 8500 RPM and jitter between 8600 and 8500 until the user shifts (p)

Idle will be around 800-850 RPM semi randomly

        How to randomly set idle RPM:
            1. Select a random number between 800 and 850
            2. Decrement / Increment RPM value to that number at a set speed (will figure it out)
            3. Loop this until throttle is clicked
        Set this as a function and start running it until either throttle is clicked OR RPMs slow down to 850

Braking (i forgot about this)

Braking (l) will decrease RPMs down to 850 rapidly

Gears

Upshift will be P and downshift will be ;

downshifting will jump RPMs quickly about 2000

1st gear will cap at 40 MPH

2nd gear will cap at 60 MPH

3rd gear will cap at 80 MPH

4th gear will cap at 100 MPH

5th gear will cap at 120 MPH

6th gear will cap at 140 MPH
